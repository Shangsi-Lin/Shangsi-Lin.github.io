## About this "Icon"

![](image/LK_Signature.jpg)

Shangsi Lin tries to put the above "icon" on almost every personal belongings that he possibly can, including his iPad, computer screen, notebooks, exam papers, cheatsheets, etc. He does this for absolutely no reason and since he sort of "invented" this icon all the way back to primary school, he can't really remember if there are any "meanings" behind this icon. Fun fact: he Also uses this as his signature on receipts.
